# Bank_Churn_Prediction

# 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models, helping financial institutions better understand customer behavior and reduce attrition. The analysis was done on real-world datasets, with detailed preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation steps.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic and behavioral features.
- **Dataset Size:** 175,000+ rows from two datasets (merged)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Models:** Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes

## 🔧 Key Contributions

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
  Merged two datasets, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and applied feature scaling (MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder).
  
- 📊 **EDA & Feature Selection:**  
  Performed exploratory analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Used SelectKBest (Chi-Square), RFECV, and FAMD for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.

- 🧠 **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  Trained four classifiers and evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
  ✅ **Best Result:** Random Forest with **85% Accuracy** and **84% F1-Score**

- 💡 **Insights Discovered:**  
  Customers who were older, less active, or held fewer products were more likely to churn — providing actionable insights for retention.
